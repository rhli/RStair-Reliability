# Reliability Analysis Tool for R-STAIR code

Genenrating data for R-STAIR codes reliability analysis

There are two components: analysis for independent failures and analysis for
failure bursts

## Independent failures

We analysis use Markov model.

We generate transition rates among states.

## Failure bursts

We use Monto Carlo simulations to study the probability of data loss and the
proportion of lost data.
